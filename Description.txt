Created a sample site that captures my knowledge at the time of publication. 
This site is written only in HTML \ CSS The site is adapted, simple and reliable.

The site can be used by someone else, I will only be glad of the usefulness)
The site is written from the usual layout from Figma, which was also in the public domain.

The site will go for a personal resume as a separate site with personal work, 
as well as to place on the job exchanges.
